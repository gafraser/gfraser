Since 2006 I’ve been working to improve resilience within the financial services sector, helping to ensure that large banks meet their moral and societal expectations in the provision of banking services.
I’m currently interested in:
Resilience issues caused by systemic complexity Data vaulting and tertiary data copies Chaos Engineering for identification of failures in production Adaptation of complex enterprise architectures for a cloud-native world Response systems for maintaining service during incidents I’ve created this site to share articles or information which I feel is relevant or relating to Enterprise Resilience.</description></item></channel></rss>

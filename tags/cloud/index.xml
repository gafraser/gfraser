      <description>Disaster Recovery in the Cloud
A guide for the selection of disaster recovery strategies when deploying applications in cloud environments.
The availability and fast provisioning capabilities of external cloud providers has led to a desire to use these services for the development and hosting of applications.
This paper outlines the acceptable practices for the utilisation of these environments to retain policy compliance. It does not cover Security &amp;amp; Data protection requirements, nor does it cover low level strategies or solutions to meet Resilience requirements which will be expanded on in a later paper.</description>
